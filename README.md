# GioMhail Demo
This is the demo version of the GioMhail by Coolgle.

GioMhail is a simple, command-line email client designed and built by
Misha Kotlik and Gio Topa.

It uses the POP3 and SMTP protocols to read and send emails.
All commands and interactions are self-explanatory, as the client guides you as you use it.
